        <h1>PROJECT STATEMENT</h1>
        </div>
        <p>I am asking for people to give me 3 daily tasks that I will implement into my routine for a period of 7 days. I am documenting these tasks visually/verbally. After I complete a person's 3 daily tasks for 7 days, I will do them any 1 favor of their choosing.
        </p>

        <p>What interests me is exploring relationships shared between record keeping, documentation and daily life. Through this exploration I hope to gain a better understanding of myself and how daily structures work for me. I want to find small ways to be thankful for each day I am here to live. I want to improve at asking for help.
        </p>

        <p>Hopefully you find nuggets within my project to latch on to, that resonate with you. I hope you enjoy flipping through the pages, and that you feel things or think things that perhaps you would not have otherwise. I hope that this project helps you, if even for a small instance, feel a bit less alone in this world.
        </p>

        <p>This is my boring and amazing and desperate attempt to find meaning and rhythm in the day to day. Thanks for being here.
        </p>

        <p>Stay fresh,</p>
